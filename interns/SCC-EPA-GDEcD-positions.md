# Georgia 2020 

## Summer Internships - Programming and Data Science

We've filled our intern positions at Georgia Tech and would like to hear from PhD students working at other Georgia universities who are interested in helping to develop the USEEIO model using R-Language, Python and JavaScript.  <a href="../../localsite/info/input/">Send Your Input</a> and <a href="../challenge" target="gaother">Register for Web Challenge</a>. 

Project interns will develop sustainability tools with the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Dept of Economic Development (GDEcD), and Georgia communities
as part of the [Regional Sustainability and Environmental Sciences Research Program](https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses)
(see 'Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models') to build open-source community web applications that
use an EPA life cycle model of the economy ([USEEIO](https://www.google.com/search?q=USEEIO)) along with Georgia community data to assess community sustainability and economic development.<br>

<a name="community-material-flow"></a><br><br>
<b>Job Description 1</b><h2 style='margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px'>Community Material Flow Tracking and Analysis</h2>

### Description
The candidate will develop Python code to translate community and industry material flow data
 -- including on generation, transfer, recycling/reprocessing, and reuse -- to relate them to EPA's USEEIO model to enable 
 sustainability analysis of alternative material uses.   

The work will require close technical collaboration with the research mentors and GA Tech research partner, the USEEIO modeling team and other community-based interns.

The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in the September community application
 development virtual event @GA Tech to leverage this tool to serve community applications.

The candidate will be exposed to the latest in sustainable materials management modeling, make contacts at
federal, state agencies, GA Tech, in industry, and become part of a dynamic modeling and research team.

### Learning Goals
Learn essentials of environmentally-extended input-output modeling

Learn about material life cycles

### Top Desired Skills
Python with data science and API libraries (pandas, requests)

Github

Team code development in a git-environment

Strong interest in sustainability and economic development

### Deliverables
Python code and documentation to capture community material generation, transfer, recycling and reuse data and link it to USEEIO

<b>Job Description 2</b>
<h2 style='margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px'>New Technology Scenario Analysis</h2>

### Description
Communities are interested in evaluating the costs and benefits of new technologies and investments on their sustainability.
To evaluate this with the EPA's USEEIO model, the new technologies need to be modeled as a change in the monetary production
recipe (the purchases made by an industry) as well as in their direct resource use and emissions. The candidate will help
translate new technologies models into this format using the useeior modeling framework to enable scenario analysis.

The work will require close technical collaboration with the research mentors and GA Tech research partner, the USEEIO modeling team
 and other community-based interns.

The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in the September community application
 development virtual event @GA Tech to leverage this tool to serve community applications.

The candidate will be exposed to the latest in sustainable materials management modeling, make contacts at
federal, state agencies, GA Tech, in industry, and become part of a dynamic modeling and research team.


### Learning Goals
Learn essentials of environmentally-extended input-output modeling

Learn how to model compare sustainability of new and existing technologies

Learn USEPA's useeior (R language) modeling framework

### Top Desired Skills
R language

Github

Team code development in a git-environment

Strong interest in sustainability and economic development

### Deliverables
R code and documentation to model new technologies in USEEIO  

<a name="machine-learning"></a><br><br>
<b>Job Description 3</b><h2 style='margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px'>Data Visualization and Machine Learning</h2>

### Description
The candidate will develop D3 javascript to create visualizations of material flows and related economic and environmental data used in the GA version of the USEEIO model.  The candidate will also use Python code to apply machine learning algorithms to material flows and other environmental and economic data from the local regions to be used in the GA version of the USEEIO model.

The work will require close technical collaboration with the research mentors and GA Tech research partner, the USEEIO modeling team and other community-based interns.

The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in the September community application
 development virtual event @GA Tech to leverage this tool to serve community applications.

The candidate will be exposed to the latest in sustainable materials management modeling, make contacts at
federal, state agencies, GA Tech, in industry, and become part of a dynamic modeling and research team.

### Learning Goals
Learn to visualize economic and material flow data

Learn about material life cycles

### Top Desired Skills
D3
Python with data science and API libraries (pandas, requests)
Github
Team code development in a git-environment
Strong interest in sustainability and economic development

### Deliverables
D3 code for visualizations of material flows and USEEIO model data that can be used in the community web application
Python code and documentation to apply machine learning algorithms to material flow and other environmental data
