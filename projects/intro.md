<!--
The Better Civic Site implementation uses Drupal, Django and ERPNext to provide rapidly deployable, disposable backends that allow for easy contributions by volunteers and contractors.

Neighborhood.org themes include Marvel Comics and the Last Airbender. We're extending the [DemocracyLab](https://democracylab.org) project tools to add [voting tools](https://github.com/kevmoo/vote.dart).

We're integrating the project index tools that Code for America is creating from Italy’s meta-tag editor, and include both login.gov and BrightID login’s for unique user validation.

<h4>Immediate Needs</h4>

<!-- Figma -->

- [Attend a meetup](../../io/coders/) and help setup [Citizen Lab Engagement Tools](https://www.citizenlab.co) to provide mobile survey apps with Open Seattle and Code for Atlanta.

- Apply the Blitz survey fields (Question and Choice) to our Real World 2.0 [planning repo](https://neighborhood.org/planning/#display=planning.md) ([GitHub](https://github.com/localsite/planning)) from the [Blitz survey builder tutorial](https://blitzjs.com/docs/tutorial).

- Compare our Tabulator and Material UI display of static JSON files for manufacturing [input-output and local job](../../localsite/info/data/) widgets.

- Format [impact labels](../../community/projects/#widgets) with TypeScript from static JSON using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), Blitz, [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and/or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io). Experiment with Tailwind CSS in our [planning repo](https://neighborhood.org/planning/#display=planning.md) ([GitHub](https://github.com/localsite/planning))


- Start an Open AI Codex example that interacts with the static JSON.

- Add clickable topics based on the <a href="../../../community/map/ewg/">EWG legend sample</a> to our [Leaflet map](../../localsite/map/). Display the same layers that reside under the upper right icon.

- Optimize the <a href="../../io/template/feed/">Building Transparency feed display</a> to <a href="https://model.earth/localsite/info/?show=openepd&mapview=state#state=GA">load the map in under 0.5 seconds</a>.

- Add to our <a href="../../apps/beyondcarbon/#state=NC">Beyond Carbon json display</a> to use the new <a href="https://github.com/modelearth/beyond-carbon-scraper">Beyond Carbon Scraper and Fuser</a> for [state CO<sub>2</sub> colors](../../apps/beyondcarbon/#mapview=country).

- Inquire with See-Click-Fix regarding adding domains so we can avoid [CORS error](../../community/resources/diffbot/#feed=open311) when pulling from the <a href="http://dev.seeclickfix.com/">See-Click-Fix open311 API</a>.<!--Have them add model.earth, neighborhood.org and lifecycle.tools.-->

- Integrate and update <a href="https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org">CloudCarbonFootprint.org widgets</a>. Investigate if these can be applied to sites hosted using GitHub Pages with Cloudflare caching.

<h4>Emissions Dashboard</h4>

Georgia Tech, UGA, Emory and the Ray Anderson Foundation are developing an [Emissions Dashboard](https://cepl.gatech.edu/dashboardseminars) focused on local sources and sinks for greenhouse gas emissions. The new tools use the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html) along with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) open API and other federal datasets - some of which are also included in the USEEIO/Flowsa [data pipeline](../../localsite/info/data) used in our [site widgets](../../io/charts).

<h4>Environmentally-Extended Input Output Data</h4>

[The EPA's USEEIO widgets](../../io/charts/) use the EIA energy data and other input-output flow data compiled by flowsa. [View list of data sources](../../io/about/api).
