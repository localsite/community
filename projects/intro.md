The Better Civic Site implementation uses Drupal, Django and ERPNext to provide rapidly deployable, disposable backends that allow for easy contributions by volunteers and contractors.

Neighborhood.org themes include Marvel Comics and the Last Airbender. We're extending the [DemocracyLab](https://democracylab.org) project tools to add [voting tools](https://github.com/kevmoo/vote.dart).

We're integrating the project index tools that Code for America is creating from Italy’s meta-tag editor, and include both login.gov and BrightID login’s for unique user validation.

<h4>Immediate Needs</h4>

Optimize the <a href="../../io/template/feed/">Building Transparency feed display</a> to <a href="https://model.earth/localsite/info/?show=openepd&mapview=state#state=GA">load the map in under 0.5 seconds</a>.

Pull list of local project/repair needs from <a href="http://dev.seeclickfix.com/">See-Click-Fix open311 API</a>.

DONE: Update the <a href="../../apps/beyondcarbon/#state=NC">Beyond Carbon json display</a> to use the new <a href="https://github.com/modelearth/beyond-carbon-scraper">Beyond Carbon Scraper and Fuser</a> for [state CO<sub>2</sub> colors](../../apps/beyondcarbon/#mapview=state).

<h4>Emissions Dashboard</h4>

Georgia Tech, UGA, Emory and the Ray Anderson Foundation are developing an [Emissions Dashboard](https://cepl.gatech.edu/dashboardseminars) focused on local sources and sinks for greenhouse gas emissions. Drawdown Georgia uses the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html) along with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) open API and other federal datasets - some of which are also included in the USEEIO/Flowsa data pipeline. 

<h4>Environmentally-Extended Input Output Data</h4>

[The EPA's USEEIO widgets](../../io/charts/) use the EIA energy data and other input-output flow data compiled by flowsa. [View list of data sources](../../io/about/api).
