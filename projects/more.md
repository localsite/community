## Dive into Google Data Commons API

[Install Data Commons Lite](../../localsite/info/data/datacommons/) on your local computer.  

Find and pull US census data by state and county from the Google Data Commons API. 

Add an "[Environment > Impact](https://datacommons.org/place/country/USA?topic=Environment)" section to Google Data commons using the [EPA IO Widgets](../../io/charts/).  

Use and improve the Google Data Common's checkbox heirarchy - [sample](https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#place=zip%2F30318&statsVar=Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C0__Count_Person_60To61Years_BornInOtherStateInTheUnitedStates%2C0%2C6%2C7%2C1%2C0%2CCount_Person__Count_Person_5To17Years_BornInStateOfResidence%2C0%2C6%2C1%2C1%2C1__WagesAnnual_Establishment%2C9%2C0__Count_Establishment%2C9%2C2&chart=%7B%22count%22%3A%7B%22pc%22%3Afalse%7D%7D)  

Add highlighted colors similar to BEA  
[View sample](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=150&step=3&isuri=1&table_list=5013&categories=compbyind), click Table > Bar Chart and choose industries.

## Crowdsource Editor - Google REST App

1. Create a [Google Sheet Editor](https://model.earth/editor) for crowdsourcing updates. Code for America Brigades often use Google Sheets to maintain directories, like these maps: [Georgia](https://www.georgia.org/covid19suppliersmap) and [North Carolina](https://nccovidsupport.org/). Use a REST process allowing editors to return and update their own row contributions using a social login process with an online form, without having access to edit rows of other contributors. Avoid Zapier or other time-intensive setup approaches.

1. See our 

1. Work with a [JAMstack Editor](https://headlesscms.org/) to edit CSV files directly on GitHub using social logins.


## .NET Core 5.0 Projects

1. Create a "Disposable Database" for editing crowdsourced lists using .csv files hosted in GitHub, Google Sheets, AirTables and/or Azure.  Document your REST process using a [RealWorld example page](https://neighborhood.org/realworld) to integrate frontend and backend tools.  

1. Add USEEIO widgets to [.NET Environmental Education tools](https://model.earth/setup/) for GEEP partner states and countries.
