# Forests Fertilized with Biosolids

Biosolid waste (aka sewage sludge) is an excellent fertilizer for forests and other bioproducts grown independent of the food chain.  

Some restaurants and grocery stores sell food fertilized with municipal biosolid sludge. "Sludge contains pharmaceuticals, hormones, pathogens, <!--bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasitic worms, as well as--> heavy metals like lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. It often includes PCBs, PFAS (forever chemicals), dioxins, BPAs and dozens of other harmful substances ranging from flame retardants to hospital waste. In 2019, about 60% of sewage sludge produced by treatment facilities will be spread on farmland and gardens, as well as schoolyards and lawns."

Let's get everyone to think before they rinse chemicals and medicine down the drain. According to the EPA, "About 50% of all biosolids are being recycled to land. These biosolids are used on less than one percent of the nation's agricultural land." [source](https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/frequent-questions-about-biosolids)  


<!-- 8) What percentage of biosolids are recycled and how many farms use biosolids? -->

Based on [stats for Maryland](https://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_docs/programs/woodland-steward/Ch17Kays.pdf), municipal sewage (biosolids) were applied as follows in 1995:  

Agricultural land (59%)  
Distributed and marketed (21%)  
Incinerated (10%)  
Marginal land applications (5%)  
Landfill disposal and out-of-state shipping (5% to 27%)  

<b>Kudos to these companies that strictly prohibit the application of sewage sludge as fertilizers:</b>  
Del Monte, H.J. Heinz, Dole, Whole Foods. Switzerland and the Netherlands.  
Sewage sludge is not allowed on USDA Certified Organic farms.  

<b>Gardener Beware:</b> The wastewater industry promotes biosolids as “green” and sells it as organic fertilizer in stores like Walmart and Lowe’s.
