### You can participate on multiple teams!

Projects use the EPA's [Environmentally-Extended Input Output widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts) 
to explore impacts at <a href="../../localsite/info/#show=brigades">US Brigade Cities</a><br>

## I. React - Environmental Profile Editor Team

Edit entity profiles for emergency response, environmental impacts, goods and services - product environmental declations (), including individual carbon footprints. [View templates](../../io/template/)  

Edit our [profile-editor](https://github.com/modelearth/profile-editor) fork of Italy's publiccode-editor to save selected Goods and Services in a file called sectors.yml. Saved list will be used for Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of company and individual carbon footprints. (Our fork will be available shortly, you can create your own fork while we wait for activation.)  

[View Interface - Italy](https://publiccode-editor.developers.italia.it/) - Best interface example currently, [view schema](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/publiccodeyml-en/en/master/schema.core.html#top-level-keys-and-sections)  
[View Interface - America](https://codeforamerica.github.io/publiccode-pusher/) - Initial login requirement to be [removed](https://github.com/codeforamerica/publiccode-pusher/issues/13)  

1. Add a Goods and Services section stored in sectors.yml and include an "Add" button for choosing sectors.
1. Pull the list of sectors from the [sectors.json file](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/master/build/api/USEEIOv2.0) in the built USEEIO-widgets repo used by the [io widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts/).
1. Include a field beside each selected sector for the dollar/euro amounts per year.  
1. Save the Goods and Services (skillbank) to the GitHub Repo in the sectors.yml file.  
1. Provide fields for indicating if each of entity's Goods and Services are more sustainable than the average provider.  
1. Include a field for setting the year and save prior years as: sectors-2020.yml, etc.  
1. Store additional entiy info for organizations and individuals in a file called profile.yml.

## II. GitHub Actions Automation

Add a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) that updates our [Farm Fresh data pull](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/python/farmfresh) nightly. 

Create a node script that pulls 3 repos (localsite, io and apps) into one "webroot" repo.  

Output [All the Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) into zip folders in our [zip/io/data repo](https://model.earth/zip/io/)<!-- generated by Kathryn Winglee. -->.  

**Our prior GitHub Actions samples**  
[Scrape city site and save json file using Python](https://github.com/abrie/atl-council-scraper) - Abrie  
[Pull from PDF to a CSV file using R script](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data) - Brant and Abrie  

## III. Map Projects


Update map.js to include a choropleth map layer with industry density for [show=vehicles](../../localsite/info/#show=vehicles) to represent <a href="mobility/">locations potentially impacted by the transition to EV</a>. See [choropleth map samples](../start/maps/).   

Activate a clickable legend in the map.js file. Place checkboxes before legend items to filter the map points and list below the map.  

Add mockups of integrated interfaces for Department of Labor tools like the [Georgia Labor Market Explorer](https://explorer.gdol.ga.gov/vosnet/Logoff.aspx?Displayonly=1&utype=L&plang=E)  


<!--
Update county [data prep scripts](../../localsite/info/data/) to include zip codes. Get latest from summer intern John Taylor.  
-->

Find a source of "regions within states" based on sets of counties. Apply to [region_select dropdown](../../localsite/info/#state=GA).  

Move items above into our [Beyond Carbon Project Board](https://github.com/localsite/localsite/projects/1). See [Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7) examples.  
<!-- Project created from Automated kanban with reviews template. -->

DONE - Akilah assisted displaying the [Beyond Carbon](../../apps/beyondcarbon/) state results as a table with state names.  

DONE - Kathryn generated state dropdown script from [R-Language script](../../community-data/us/) to include lat/lon attributes for the [brigade map zoom](../../localsite/info/#show=industries&layers=brigades).  

DONE - Kathryn created files for all US zip codes.  She used the [uszipcode programmable database (Python)](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) - [Github](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/uszipcode-project) to generate [a data file for each zip code](https://model.earth/zip/io/#zip=30310). Here's the [processing script](https://github.com/modelearth/zip/tree/master/io).



<!--
DONE - Pull Data to GitHub. Abrie fixed the [Vaccine dosage pull to GitHub](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data/pull/1), now we need to [push into a Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=Github+Actions+send+data+to+Google+Sheet&oq=Github+A[…]et&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.20842j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  


Generate static files to drive Data Commons navigation. Crosswalk zipcodes and counties to PUMA regions. This crosswalk resides in DataUSA.io Github repo. 

1. Contribute to our [AWS Amplify React](../aws/amplify/) repo by activating [Last Airbender indicator sets](../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/).  


1. Update EPA's <a href="../../io/charts/">Embeddable IO Widgets</a> generated from [USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) local .json data.  
-->
<!--Auto-select all categories in center column when populated from naics values.-->  


<!--
County automobile industry employment for 6-digit NAICS 336111.
4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" link [here](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm), but we will be pulling from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&nbsp;API.  
--> 


<h2>IV. Design Projects (UX/UI Teams)</h2>

## V. Python Projects

Great for Data Science and Computer Science Students  

### Python, Javascript, Leaflet Maps

We're creating a Python pipeline and Github Actions to add support for map layers with 30,000+ records, similar to Hack for LA's [Public Tree Map](https://neighborhood.org/public-tree-map/).  Start by triggering our [FarmFresh Python](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/python/farmfresh) data pull from the [community-data repo pipeline](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/).
