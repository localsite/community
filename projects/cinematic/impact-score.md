### Mini Widgets - Annual and Total Impact Scores

The mini-label will provide a quick overview of the impact score (footprint) for individuals, communities and products. Adjacent to each score will be a real-time data point - like air quality, water quality, energy use, land use, new jobs created.  View placeholder in upper right of our [community&nbsp;starter&nbsp;pages](../../../apps/)

The mini-label will expand into both the Impact Label and the Cinematic Interface.
