## React and D3 - Sankey IO Chart

1. Update the [Sankey D3 Chart](../../../io/charts/sankey/) data formatting to use the same process as the [USEEIO inflow-outflow widget](../../../io/build/iochart.html#sectors=333613,335912,336111&page=1&count=10).  

1. Info on [How to edit IO widgets](../../../io/charts/).

1. See sample [visualizations](../../start/charts/) of material flow charts.

1. Normalization input and output so sides of Sankey are even.

## React and Leaflet - Chlorpleth Map

Find and implement a React Leaflet Chlorpleth Map with a clickable legend like in [EWG](https://www.ewg.org/). Also see the [Community Forecasting Map](https://model.earth/community-forecasting). Click "Choose Area of Focus". This example was created during a team project in Polo's Data Visualization course at Georgia Tech. The Leaflet maps includes a legend with the color scale. This sample legend is not clickable, but the color scale is based on the data range.  

## React - Heatmap Mosaic

Reach out to Leo regarding updates you'd like to make in the useeio-widgets repo.

## JQuery/D3 - Bubble Chart

[On Industry Page (at bottom)](../../../localsite/info/#state=GA) - [Stand-Alone Widget for testing](../../../io/charts/bubble/) 

- Adjust initial darkness - seems to be overlapping itself.
- Rollover does not work unless loading twice. It works after toggling the red highlight. Also works on stand-alone.
- When toggling the red highlight, show the red again after toggling back. This worked until recently.
- Optional: Modify so popups still appear when the containing div is set to position:relative. 
- Optional: Scale to size of containing div during browser resize.
