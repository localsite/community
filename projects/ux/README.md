<h2>UX/UI Report Design Projects</h2>


###1. Community Hotspot Environmental Report (CHER)

Mockup a "Community Hotspot Environmental Report" (CHER) which uses zip code level industry data with [chloroform&nbsp;maps](../zip/leaflet/#columns=JobsAgriculture:50;JobsManufacturing:50) to drive USEEIO impact widgets. Update our [Impact Profile Label Samples](../../io/template/) to expand full page with graphic images that convey impacts. (Ideas: 5 stars, faces, green or burning earth, Last Airbender symbols, etc. The more options the better.)  

Collaborate with coders to drive label display using client-side Javascript.  
Design an expanded label interface that would work well as a video overlay for use in entertainment.  


###2. Last Airbender Interface


Great for students

<div class="popout">


<p>Help develop a friendly interface for students and educators using the grouped EPA indicator sets of Air, Water, Land, Energy, Wealth and Health.

<p>
Optionally, start with our blank React <a href="https://github.com/modelearth//amplifyapp">AmplifyApp</a>.<!-- (The older category set json resides in docs/static/json thanks to Alikah )--> We've documented  <a href="../../aws/amplify/">AWS Amplify set up steps</a>.

<!--as Primary and Secondary columns in <a href="../community-data/us/indicators/LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv">LCIA_Indicator_sets.csv</a> and in the [Bio-Modeling Branch](https://github.com/modelearth/useeior/blob/Bio-Modeling/inst/extdata/USEEIO_LCIA_Indicators.csv).

Here’s an <a href="https://last-airbender-api.herokuapp.com/">Airbender API</a> you can use to relate the four “nation” categories to characters.<br><br>

Get creative! Explore other movie/book themes and share how impact awareness could be an integral part of multiple forms of  entertainment.
