<h2>UX/UI Report Design Projects</h2>


###Environmental Profile Labels / OpenLCA Tabulator / Scenario Reporting

Populate labels for products, communities, families and individuals based on the Environmental Product Declaration (OpenEPD) standard. [View&nbsp;USEEIO&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;Mockup](../../../apps/smm/) of labels and tabulator.

Mockup a "Community Hotspot Environmental Report" (CHER) with [Environmental Profile Labels](../../../io/template/) that expand to full page size and include graphics and colors that convey impacts. Impact ratings could be conveyed by 5-stars, faces, green-orange-red colors, burning earth images, Last Airbender symbols, etc. The more options the better.  

Collaborate with coders to render labels using client-side Javascript with the OpenEPD API.  
Design an expanded label interface that works well as a video overlay for use in entertainment.  

Collaborate with coders to update the [impact widgets US map](../../../localsite/info/#mapview=country) with [chloroform&nbsp;map features](../../start/maps/) to show population density, state issues and industry levels.
