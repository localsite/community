## JQuery/React - Environmental Profile Directory - YAML Editor

We'll be updating a metadata editing process created by Italy to edit any entity profile stored on GitHub.  
We're combining the best of these two lable styles by placing only the number on the right side.

<div style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:15px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom:10px">
<a href="../../../io/template/"><img src="../../../io/template/img/2-labels.png" style="width:100%; max-width:600px"></a>
</div>

View our resulting [impact profile summaries inspired by "nutritional labels."](../../../io/template/) for communities, companies, products and individuals.  

Our [profile-editor](https://github.com/modelearth/profile-editor) fork of Italy's publiccode-editor will save settings in a file residing on GitHub using Code for America's version for an example. Our update will allow the form to be viewed before logging into GitHub.  

[View Interface - Italy](https://publiccode-editor.developers.italia.it/) - Best interface example currently, [view schema](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/publiccodeyml-en/en/master/schema.core.html#top-level-keys-and-sections)  
[View Interface - America](https://codeforamerica.github.io/publiccode-pusher/) - Initial login requirement to be [removed](https://github.com/codeforamerica/publiccode-pusher/issues/13)

TO DO:  
1. Add a Goods and Services section stored in sectors.yml and include an "Add" button for choosing sectors.
1. Pull the list of sectors from the [sectors.json file](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/master/build/api/USEEIOv2.0) in the built USEEIO-widgets repo used by the [io widgets](https://model.earth/io/charts/).
1. Include a field beside each selected sector for the dollar/euro amounts per year. [See OpenLCA tabulator](../../../apps/smm/).
1. Save the Goods and Services (skillbank) to the GitHub Repo in the sectors.yml file.  
1. Provide fields for indicating when an entity's Goods and Services are more sustainable than the average provider.  
1. Include a field for setting the year and save prior years as: sectors-2020.yml, etc.  
1. Store additional entity info for organizations and individuals in a file called profile.yml.
