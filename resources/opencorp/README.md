Model.earth provides Open Footprint tools that combine 24 US EPA environmental impact factors with Exiobase international trade flow to track climate change impacts, energy, land, water use, and health based impacts based on profiles of locations and products. The product profiles we pull from BuildingTransparency.org will be combined with data from the OpenCorporates API to train ML models for local and regional forecasting to identify and reduce adverse environmental impacts. Our data sources also include Google Data Commons and All The Places.

OpenCorporates API profile data will be used in our RealityStream ML interface to train environmental impact forecasting models by combining with US EPA environmental impact data, Exiobase international trade flow, BuildingTransparency environmental product footprints and Google Data Commons timeline data.

The open source datasets used in our data-pipeline include US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), US Census County Business Patterns (CBP), Exiobase international trade flow, BuildingTransparency.org and Google Data Commons UN Goals timeline datasets.

Are you an NGO or non-profit partner with access to the OpenCorporates.com API to validate organizations in the BuildingTransparency.org environmental product listings?

Seeking participants proficient with webhooks, Google Cloud hosting of OpenWebUI and/or the Discord API. Interested in working with the complexities of the Exiobase API and the BuildingTransparency.org API.

We're creating Open Footprint tools that are easy to integrate with websites using map filters, timeline visualizations, and AI storyboards based on locations and commodities. Our data sources include Google Data Commons, BuildingTransparency.org, All The Places and the US EPA environmentally extended input-output model.

We're integrating eCharts and ObservableHQ D3 data visualizations with comparison tools that connect people to jobs and innovations focused on improving air quality, green energy, clean water, local farming & healthy environments.

Action
We're creating embeddable tools for visualizing and comparing impacts using Supabase and DuckDB with Exiobase international data, Google Data Commons and US EPA impact data to identify trends in global trade and local production using StreamLit apps for predictive analysis. Our development toolkit include Google CoLab integration with GitHub, jQuery, React Vite, NextJS with GitHub Pages, Python with Open WebUI CloudFlare hosting using Bun, Observable Framework for static sites, and a wide variety of public APIs including SeeClickFix and NASA data feeds.
