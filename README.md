1. A collection of [EE Input-Output chart widgets](https://modelearth.github.io/io/charts) is being created using the [USEEIO API](https://github.com/usepa/useeio_api/wiki/Use-the-API). Chart widgets are loaded from JSON files generated from 
our [API endpoints on AWS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/useeio-api-go-swagger-staging/index.html) <!-- also https://smmtool.app.cloud.gov/ -->for Goods & Services demand vectors (Food System and Full System).  

2. [Goods & Services Reports](info/) for communities with environmental impacts of new technologies.   

3. [Maps of products and industries](start/maps) - Regional hubs, industries by zipcode.  

4. [Visualizations](start/charts/) of material flow and regional input-output.  

5. [Google Sheet Editor](https://neighborhood.org/editor) for local and state datasets.

1. Preprocess data from the [uszipcode programmable database (Python)](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) - [Github](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/uszipcode-project).
