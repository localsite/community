Production of fuels and chemicals from biomass can potentially support rural economies and support economic development with low environmental impact.​
</p>

<p>
The USDA is sponsoring a research project involving researchers at Northwestern University, University of South Florida, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and LanzaTech, on technology for production of fuels and chemicals from biomass using <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/03/f61/Engineered%20reversal%20of%20the%20beta%20oxidation%20cycle%20in%20clostridia%20for%20the%20synthesis%20of%20fuels%20and%20chemicals_EE0008354.pdf">reversal of the β-oxidation cycle</a> This specific technology could produce, for example, components for plastics made from wood waste rather than from natural gas or petroleum.​
</p>

<p>
We are interested in conversations with stakeholders, to hear about the issues that matter to community members, to environmental advocates, and to people working all along the supply chain of fuel and chemical production in the southeast.
</p>

<p style="display:none">
  We will have a stakeholders meeting on March 3 at the Georgia Tech Renewable Bioproducts Institute and we welcome participation.​

<br>

<!--
One idea: Carbon retention level could reside in the extended NAICS values as a range of 000 to 100, and up to 999 on a logrithmic scale for net-positive technologies that absorb surrounding carbon.  Example: A syngas production tech would start with 325120 for “Industrial Gas Manufacturing.” Then we could add three digits for the subtype of the industry (so randomly 0233 for non-thermal syngas production), followed by 000 to 999 for the level of carbon capture. Resulting in: 325120.0233.000 for a process that releases carbon monoxide into the air. If a technology captures carbon from the surrounding environment, the net-positive value could increase the carbon capture indicator beyond 100.<br><br>

	"The proposed anaerobic membrane biological treatment process will transfer organic contaminants into biogas and remove pathogens such as E. coli to ensure food safety, but the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for example) will remain. By using a smart membrane or nanomaterials to extract trace contaminants like endocrine disruptors, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals, the nutrients that are left can be pumped through a vertical hydroponic system to grow produce without adding fertilizer. The project will monitor water and produce quality and measure contamination from chemicals and microbes continuously."

	PRISM<sup style="font-size:.5em">TM</sup> uses low temperature plasma to produce clean hydrogen-rich, process-ready syngas from any carbonaceous feedstock affordably at room temperature. 
	Using 60 to 100 watts to operate, the process eliminates intensive energy requirements while maintaining high conversion efficiency using Catalytic Partial Oxidation (CPOX).
	Less than 1% parasitic load. Greater than 98% CO/H2. 
	PRISM is exothermic so room temp natural gas is introduced and a near pure synthesis gas exits at around 800°c. -

	Conversion of biomass to syngas is typically low-yield.

The catalyst can be operated at atmospheric pressure and reduces char. The entire process is autothermic and therefore heating is not required.  Another process has been developed at DTU Energy which is efficient and does not have any issues of fouling of the catalyst (in this case a cerium oxide catalyst). - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngas">Source: wiki</a><br><br>

<h3>Bioeconomy Stage 3 (2030-2050):</h3>
<h1>Monetizing Captured Biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> as Feedstock</h1>

Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from biological sources and using it to produce algae, plastics, transport fuels, animal feed and other chemicals/materials will help reduce emissions in the second half of the 21st century. - <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/going-carbon-negative-what-are-the-technology-options">Going Carbon Negative</a><br><br>

CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock is a more lucrative alternative to pumping it underground into rock formations. "Today, there are 19 large-scale commercial carbon capture and sequestration facilities operating around the world, 10 of which are in the United States, according to the Global CCS Institute. All of them are pulling carbon dioxide out of the emissions from an associated factory or power plant. Systems that pull CO<sub>2</sub> out of the ambient air also exist, but they’re harder and more expensive to operate because the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air is so much lower. At a power plant, 10 to 20 percent of what goes up the smokestack is CO<sub>2</sub>, compared to .04 percent in the air.” - <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-carbon-capture-hasnt-saved-us-from-climate-change-yet/">Why CCS hasn't saved us yet</a><br><br>

<!--
Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has been tested at industrial scale in the U.S. to store carbon in sandstone at the Archer Daniels Midland (<a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2020/11/19/despite-hundreds-of-millions-in-tax-dollars-adms-carbon-capture-program-still-hasnt-met-promised-goals/">ADM</a>) bioethanol plant. 
-->

In 2018, Congress passed a tax credit that rewards companies for each metric ton of carbon dioxide they lock away. Most is currently used to extract more fossil fuels. - <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:26%20section:45Q%20edition:prelim)" style="white-space: nowrap;">Details on tax credit</a><br><br>

In Switzerland, <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> pulls CO<sub>2</sub> out of the air and sells it to soda companies and agricultural interests. They pump it into greenhouses to increase the yield on tomatoes, but have to compete with naturally occurring CO<sub>2</sub> extracted from the ground.

<!--
Whether using as a feedstock or pumping into rock formations, the process of capturing carbon from flue gas with CO<sub>2</sub> levels of 10%, is more bountiful than Direct Air Capture (DAC) since atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels are only 0.04%.<br><br>
