      To establish a mature, native forest in ten times the normal rate of forests planted by humans, amend the soil to a depth of one meter using a locally abundant biomass. Plant three to five saplings per square meter. "This grows into a forest so dense that after eight months, sunlight can’t reach the ground. At this point, every drop of rain that falls is conserved, and every leaf that falls is converted into humus. The more the forest grows, the more it generates nutrients for itself, accelerating further growth. This density also means that individual trees begin competing for sunlight — another reason these forests grow so fast." - <a href="https://fellowsblog.ted.com/how-to-grow-a-forest-really-really-fast-d27df202ba09">TED Fellows</a><br><br>

      Carbon capture varies widely based on the final use of wood pellets for fuel. 
      The European energy industry is using subsidies to outbid the US wood construction and biochemical industry for biomass, which includes low-value whole trees, branches and waste wood chips. Under current trade policies, as more countries export US wood pellets, their power plants may not have the same carbon capture goals as the <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/features/draxs-carbon-capture/">Drax</a> biomass energy plant in the United Kingdom.

    Creosote-coated ties are a well known carcinogen, yet they remain in wide use in the railroad industry, despite being banned for consumer&nbsp;use. 
    In contrast, all-rubber railroad ties made from recycled car tire rubber last several times longer, and can be continually recycled into new railroad ties. They reduce sound and vibrations, and permanently capture carbon, unlike cement railroad ties which release carbon dioxide from limestone during production.<br><br>

    <h1>Hydrogen Fuel</h1>

    "Right now, hydrogen is produced mainly by splitting hydrogen atoms from natural gas—an emissions-heavy process. If it were its own country, the global hydrogen industry would rank sixth in greenhouse gas emissions, according to 2017 data from energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. “It’s like the size of Germany,” says Merrian Borgeson, staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. “Just cleaning that up would be tremendously powerful.” - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-28/what-the-world-gets-if-u-s-electricity-becomes-100-green?srnd=premium">Bloomberg 2020-07-28</a><br><br>

    A standard pipeline can transfer up to ten times as much energy as a 380-kilovolt twin overhead power line with a rating of 1.5 gigawatts, at about one fourteenth of specific cost.<br><br>
  
    <a href="https://www.cleanegroup.org/hydrogen-hype-in-the-air/">Hydrogen Hype in the Air - The unhealthy mixing of Hydrogen and Natural Gas</a><br>
    "H2 combustion can produce dangerously high levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx). Two European studies have found that burning hydrogen-enriched natural gas in an industrial setting can lead to NOx emissions up to six times that of methane (the most common element in natural gas mixes). Long-term exposure to NOx increases the risk of respiratory conditions and heightens sensitivity to allergens. NOx is also a precursor to the formation of fine particles and ground-level ozone, which are both associated with severe adverse health effects."<br><br>

    Setting health concerns aside, in June of 2021 the European Union agreed existing natural gas pipelines funded for conversion to hydrogen will be allowed to transport a blend of hydrogen with natural gas or biomethane until 2029. Electrolyzers must account for at least 100 MW capacity in each pipeline project - paving the way toward a healthier hydrogen future.<br><br>
