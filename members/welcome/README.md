We ask that participants not list us on their resume or LinkedIn until they've been actively contributing updates for a few weeks. Your contributions to our team projects provide a basis for assessment if job interviewers contact us to confirm ongoing participation.

**Select Projects:** Add your name after a TO DO you're interested in on our [Active Projects Page](../../../projects), or edit README pages and CoLabs. Send a PR to add yourself to a project and add notes in our README files as you contribute code.

**Active OPT Volunteers:** To remain active as an OPT volunteer, please contribute at least one Pull Request (PR) per week.  The time commitment is significant as the OPT program requires 20+ hours per week.  As you update code, also edit README files throughout our repos. Add status updates and deployment steps for others, correct existing notes and add new documentation.

We use email threads to track involvement.  Some contributors also like to enter [weekly logs in a speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wvw_xsFWnYE9z8nDQqmu1m2LB5TJEfy5VLkaFuEaCfk/edit?usp=sharing).  

**Steps for pulling down our repos:** [Fork and clone related repos](../../../localsite/start/steps/) - Turn on Github Pages for both your fork of the repo and your fork of the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/). When submiting a PR, also send an email including a review link. Your review link will be: [youraccount].github.io/[therepo] 

Send an email whenever you send a pull request. If you are uncertain about an edit, make your best guess and submit the PR anyway. Include any uncertainties in the email you send after submitting the PR.
