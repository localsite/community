<h2>US EPA + Code for America</h2>

<a href="../">Web Challenge Details</a><br><br>

<a href="../../projects/">View Project Areas</a> - International participants are welcome!<br><br>

We are seeking community partners that might be interested in using innovative new tools that can provide information on the potential environmental and economic outcomes of changes that effect goods and services produced and consumed within a community. We are also looking for volunteers to help shape these tools for easier and better integration into websites tailored for your communities.<br><br>

Please join the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Georgia Department of Economic Development Centers for Innovation in partnership with Code for America at one of two information sessions in June 2021 for a sneak peek at a Federal Challenge event being planned for the Fall of 2021.<br><br>

<!--
Registration is not required however an RSVP would be appreciated.<br><br>

More Background: U.S. EPA and GA Dept of Economic Development (GDEcD), with the help of GA Tech Smart Community Corp and Code for America volunteers, have developed web-based tools that report the environmental and economic impact of industries in both local communities, state regions and the entire US using 24 indicators, including jobs, value-added, air quality, climate impact, energy use, water use and land use. These tools use the US EPAâ€™s premier model for estimating environmental profiles of industries and goods and services that embody a life cycle perspective called USEEIO. They are coupled with local employment, industry, and geographic data to provide more community-specific insight.  <!--To read more about our plans and see some of our progress, see https://model.earth/community/challenge/
