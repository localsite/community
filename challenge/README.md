We're looking for communities, companies and coders to participate in implementing innovative sustainability apps created in partnership with the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>.

We'll be using the new environmentally-extended input-output model called 
<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=336332" target="_blank">USEEIO</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>.

We're combining national and state-level economic data, community resources and planning input from local communities to customize new environmental indicator models to meet&nbsp;community&nbsp;needs.<br>
View [Industry Evaluator](../info/) and [Embeddable IO Charts](https://modelearth.github.io/io/charts/) being developed.
