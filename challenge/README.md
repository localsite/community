<h1 style="font-weight:300">Sustainable Communities <span style="white-space:nowrap">Web Challenge</span></h1>

We're looking for communities, companies and coders to participate in implementing innovative sustainability apps created in partnership with the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>. 
<!--
We'll be using the new environmentally-extended input-output model called 
<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=336332" target="_blank">USEEIO</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_parent">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>. 
-->
We're combining national and state-level economic data, community resources and planning input from local communities to customize new environmental indicator models to meet community needs. Check out the [Input-Output Starter Widgets](https://modelearth.github.io/io/charts/) being developed.
