# Rules for Entries

- Entries must include a community page using the modelearth localsite framework and IO widgets. See the [Getting Started steps](../../localsite/start/) for details.    
- Entries should be maintained in one or more public github repositories. 
- Entries should be easy to integrate with other projects.  
- Please avoid using CMS content systems like Wix and WordPress.  
- Provide documentation of set-up steps in a markdown file.
- Include an index.html file that loads your readme.md file into HTML  
  (The "[localsite](../../localsite/)" repo provides a process for displaying readme files.). 
- Detached frontends should have an index.html file in their root.
- Detached frontends should work under any domain when hosted as a Github fork.  
- Static frontend may be hosted for free using GitHub.
- If your entry is associated with additional data, provide free or very affordable options for hosting associated data. <!--API's and Websockets (Over $20/month, Under $20/month, Free!)-->  

# Judging Criteria  

All entries must conform with rules stated above, and must include well-documented setup steps.

Judges will evaluate your entry based on four main criteria:

- **Impact**: Does the entry have a real-world impact for addressing the challenge?
- **Innovation**: Is the entry innovative and creative, taking a novel approach?
- **Clarity**: Is the entry easy to understand and accessible? Does it present information clearly?
- **Implementation**: How much progress was made on a working solution?

A bonus will be given for:

- **Integration**: Does the entry integrate with other data sources in a community-relevant way?
