</div>

<p>
The US Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model (USEEIO) is a national life cycle model created by the US Environmental Protection Agency that combines environmental and economic data
    to characterize both positive and negative effects associated with the production and consumption of goods and services in the United States.
    It tracks close to 400 commodities and over 2000 resources, emissions, and waste types to characterize 20+ environmental and economic indicators.
USEEIO is widely used by corporations, including Amazon, nonprofits, government and academia for applications such as carbon footprinting and sector-based environmental assessment.
USEEIO is an analytical model that can be used to support sustainable materials management.
</p>

<h3>Sustainable Materials Management</h3>
<p>
Sustainable materials management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire life cycle.
It represents a change in how our society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By looking at a product's entire life cycle,
we can find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, reduce costs and attract new industries.
